			<p>Regardless of that, you need to learn some things to start your trading journey. Understanding crypto is
				not as difficult as it may seem, but it does require some effort. Many cryptocurrencies are waiting for
				you to start using them and trading with them. </p>
			<p>Trading can benefit you in many aspects of your life. You don't have to be scared to try new things.

					<h2 class="title">What Is Crypto?</h2>
					<p><b>Crypto, or cryptocurrencies, are digital assets you can use to buy all kinds of items and
							services online. These currencies started to get popular with the arrival of Bitcoin in
							2009. However, there are many other cryptocurrencies apart from Bitcoin.  </b></p>
					<p>People love using crypto for their transactions since it gives them more freedom when sending
						money to another person. That’s because crypto is a decentralized currency, which means it’s not
						limited by banks or governments.</p>
					<p>Cryptocurrencies follow a whole different process when making transactions. That process is more
						complex than normal bank purchases. However, mastering it and using crypto offers many
						advantages that other currencies lack.  </p>
					<p>Regardless of that, you need to choose the right cryptocurrency to invest in. Not all digital
						assets are suitable for everyone. That’s because their value depends on how the market behaves.
						 </p>
					<p>These currencies’ value changes from time to time. That value can increase or decrease depending
						on what's happening at the moment or the people who invest in it. You need to understand the
						market fluctuates and use the right resources to make informed decisions and invest in the right
						cryptocurrencies. Crypto Genius gives you access to these resources, all in one platform. </p>

		<div class="container text-center" style="max-width: 1200px;">
			<h2 class="title">How Can You Make Crypto Transactions?</h2>
			<p><b>As mentioned before, the process needed for crypto transactions is way different from the process you
					will go through making a transaction through a bank. The first thing you need to do is get a crypto
					wallet. This wallet is digital, and you can get it from several websites.</b></p>
			<p>Since this wallet is digital, you need an access key to see your funds and assets. That access key is a
				code, so you should write it down or try to remember it. However, the access key only lets you see your
				funds. That’s the reason crypto wallets come with two keys: the access key and the signing key.</p>
			<p>The signing key code is used to send money to another person. The individual receiving the funds receives
				a part of your signing key. Losing any or both keys can make you lose everything you have in your
				wallet, so try to keep the codes somewhere safe.</p>
			<p>Regardless of that, when you make a crypto transaction, it goes through a blockchain system. The
				blockchain server is where all crypto transactions are stored. That means all the data regarding any
				transaction made worldwide is there. </p>
			<p>It’s called blockchain because it’s made of blocks of data. The blockchain server is public. That means
				you are completely safe from any threat that could put your funds or information in danger. </p>
			<p>In short, cryptocurrencies allow you to make international transactions. Since these currencies are
				decentralized, you can send them to any place in the world without being limited by any national or
				international entity.</p>

					<h2 class="title">Why Should You Invest in Crypto?</h2>
					<p><b>There are many reasons why investing in crypto is one of the best decisions you can make at
							the moment. For starters, the benefits this platform offers you can’t be compared to any
							other bank or financial entity worldwide. </b></p>
					<p>When making a transaction through a bank, you usually have to wait a few days for the money to be
						available for you or the other person. Apart from that, there’s always the risk of the bank
						retaining your funds for a time. Not forgetting that most of the time, you have to ask for a
						credit or debit card.</p>
					<p>All those issues disappear when using crypto for your financial movements. Crypto transactions
						are confirmed instantly, so you don’t have to wait for anything. You are also free from the risk
						of a bank retaining your money, which makes it more comfortable for you to make crypto
						transactions.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="row align-items-center">
				<div class="col-md-7">
					<p>Getting to the main question of this section, the reason you should invest in crypto is that
						these currencies are getting stronger! While no one can predict how they will do in the future,
						or even tomorrow, the overall value of cryptocurrencies is on the rise so investing in them can
						provide you with excellent benefits.</p>
					<p>Additionally, the more people invest in crypto, the more popular it gets. If more and more people
						invest in these currencies each day, that will get everyone closer to a society that makes
						crypto transactions on a regular basis. </p>
					<p>That would help you feel safer while sending money to another person. Since the blockchain server
						is public, it’s safe from hackers and cyber-attacks, so you don't have to worry about that. </p>
					<p>Cryptocurrencies are not going away. There are more currencies coming out each day, and each one
						of them offers traders and investors different benefits. Don’t hesitate to try
						cryptocurrencies! </p>

			<h2 class="title">What Is Crypto Trading?</h2>
			<p><b>Crypto trading consists of assessing how the market may behave towards a specific cryptocurrency to
					buy or sell it. Traders purchase crypto when its price decreases and sell it when it increases to
					generate profit.</b></p>
			<p>Trading has become popular these days. Yet, learning how to do it is not as easy as it may seem. The
				market is volatile, so making a mistake can lead you to a bad investment. However, that’s part of the
				learning process, so don’t get scared if that happens to you. </p>
			<p>Regardless of that, trading can be a stressful activity for professional traders. Their professional
				lives usually depend on it, so they spend all day trying to set beneficial trades and improve their
				trading skills. </p>
			<p>Trading shouldn’t be that stressful, though. If you feel anxiety and mental exhaustion while you trade,
				you may want to give it up. That’s the reason why even professional traders use trading platforms for a
				smoother experience in dealing with crypto.  </p>
			<p>Choosing the right trading platform can help with that. Join Crypto Genius to enjoy your trading
				sessions! </p>

					<h2 class="title">What Is a Trading Platform?</h2>
					<p><b> Trading platforms are designed to facilitate your crypto trading. However, not every trading
							platform works the same, so you need to pick the best for you.</b></p>
					<p>The process these platforms use to help you trade is not that complex. Analyzing the market is
						the most complicated part of trading. That’s because the market can be unpredictable, so it’s
						difficult to learn how to tell when something might go up or down. </p>
					<p>What trading platforms do is continuously analyze the market to trading easier for both beginners
						and professional traders. Trading platforms have different ways of doing that, so the best thing
						you can do is take all the time you need to look for one that offers the right solution for your
						needs. </p>

					<p><b>As the name suggests, Crypto Genius is a crypto trading platform. It was designed to help you
							learn more about trading and crypto while improving your trading skills.</b></p>
					<p>Apart from that, Crypto Genius also analyzes your previous trades to help you avoid the same
						mistakes you did before. That doesn’t mean it’s all smooth sailing or that you’re necessarily
						going to succeed with every trade you make. Crypto Genius and your account manager can simply
						suggest the options open for you to trade, while the final decision on where to invest your
						money is all up to you.</p>

			<p>As a beginner, you will benefit a lot and learn the ropes by using the platform a bit each day and
				checking the analysis done for you. On top of that, you can always use recommendations and options given
				to you by your account manager, so you can learn from previous mistakes and make better trades in the
				future. </p>
			<p>Now, you could ask yourself what, if anything, can experienced traders learn from the platform, and the
				short answer is quite a bit. </p>
			<p>The market evolves, and so do the methods used to study it. Traders need to keep up with those changes if
				they want to become professional traders in the future. Since Crypto Genius adapts to your level of
				skill and knowledge, it interacts with professionals differently than it would with absolute beginners. 
			</p>
			<p>That’s because the platform analyzes your previous trades and determines your level of skill. If it sees
				you are still learning how to trade, it puts things in a simple form to help you understand. If the
				platform notices you’re a professional, it gives you more technical information.</p>
			<p>Using crypto trading platforms can take a lot off your plate. And using Crypto Genius specifically helps
				you have a more accessible and comfortable trading experience. You can check that yourself by
				registering on the Crypto Genius website and trying the platform yourself. </p>

					<h2 class="title">Are Crypto Transactions Ending Soon?</h2>
					<p><b>The short answer is no. Crypto transactions are here to stay. Many people think that
							cryptocurrencies may become useless in a few years because of how long they’ve been on the
							market. Yet, that couldn’t be further from reality. </b></p>
					<p>There are more cryptocurrencies each day. That means that there are more investment possibilities
						you can analyze and make use of. Experts from international and national financial entities
						agree that cryptocurrencies are here to stay. It’s best if people adapt to this changing world
						and take advantage of online trading.</p>
					<p>Apart from that, more people are investing in cryptocurrencies. As mentioned before, if more
						people invest in something, its value increases. Since crypto has more investors than ever, you
						can rest assured this is not something that seems to be ending any time soon. </p>
					<p>Additionally, learning how to analyze the market and make decent trades can help you in many
						aspects of your life. That means that if crypto trading possibilities stop appearing, you can
						still use that knowledge in other professional areas.</p>
					<p>There’s no need to worry about that, though. Crypto’s future is brighter than ever, so this is
						the best moment you have to invest in the cryptocurrencies you like best.</p>
